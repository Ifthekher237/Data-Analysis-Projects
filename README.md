# Data Analysis Projects

Welcome to the Data Analysis Projects Repository. This repository showcases two insightful data analysis projects:

## USA-Accidents-Analysis

### Introduction
- A comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) project.
- Explores real-world data on accidents in the USA.
- Highlights the dataset's source and its potential for accident prevention.

### Project Structure
1. **Setting Up the Environment**
   - Installation of necessary libraries (e.g., jovian and opendatasets).
   - Downloading the dataset from Kaggle using opendatasets.

2. **Data Preparation and Cleaning**
   - Loading the dataset using Pandas.
   - Exploring basic information about the data and its columns.
   - Identifying missing values and their percentage.
   - Visualizing missing value percentages using bar plots.
   - Discussing the removal of less useful columns.

3. **Exploratory Analysis and Visualization**
   - Analyzing accident distribution by city, time of day, day of the week, and month.
   - Investigating accidents by year and potential trends.
   - Identifying high-density accident areas using heatmaps.

4. **Asking and Answering Questions**
   - Defining and answering questions related to the dataset (e.g., accidents in warmer vs. colder areas, top cities by accidents).
   
5. **Summary and Conclusion**
   - Providing insights and findings from the analysis.
   - Summarizing key observations, trends, and patterns.
   - Drawing conclusions about the dataset's implications.

6. **Documentation, Publication, and Presentation**
   - Outlining next steps, such as documentation, sharing the notebook online, and preparing for presentations or reports.

## Spotify-Data-Analysis

### Introduction
- An in-depth EDA project focusing on Spotify track features.
- Explores a dataset that showcases Spotify's music tracks.
- Highlights the dataset's source and its potential for music analysis.

### Project Structure
1. **Setting Up the Environment**
   - Importing necessary libraries (e.g., NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn).
   - Downloading the dataset from Kaggle using opendatasets.

2. **Data Loading and Preparation**
   - Loading the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
   - Adding a new column, "release date," by generating random year, month, and day values.
   - Checking for null values in the dataset and displaying summary information.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Analyzing the dataset to answer various questions and explore patterns.
   - Determining top artists and least popular songs.
   - Creating a correlation map to understand variable relationships.

4. **Correlation Analysis**
   - Visualizing variable correlations using a heatmap.
   - Creating regression plots to explore specific correlations.

5. **Time Series Analysis**
   - Exploring trends in song release years.
   - Analyzing song durations over the years.
